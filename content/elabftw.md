## What you get with the hosted solution

The hosted solution is focusing on security and data confidentiality.

### Security

The server hosting your data will host only your data. It is a CentOS Entreprise Linux server that has been very carefully configured to offer the most secure environment for your data.

Things that are configured include:

* A very strict SSH configuration
* Monitoring of changes
* Auditing of changes
* Logging of activity
* Tuned kernel settings
* and more...

### Data confidentiality

Your data is yours and yours only. There is no "sharing with third-party for marketing purposes" or other crap like this.
