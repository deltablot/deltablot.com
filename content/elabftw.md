## What you get with the hosted solution

### Peace of mind

Don't worry about software updates, vulnerabilities, backups and all the problems that might come with the self hosted option. Let us deal with that and focus on your research.

### PRO Support

PRO support is included, so you become a premium user that can orient the development of new features.

### Security

The server hosting your data will host only your data. It is a CentOS Entreprise Linux server that has been very carefully configured to offer the most secure environment for your data.

Things that are configured include:

* A very strict SSH configuration
* Monitoring of changes
* Auditing of changes
* Logging of activity
* Tuned kernel settings
* and more...

### Data confidentiality

Your data is yours and yours only. There is no "sharing with third-party for marketing purposes" or other nasty things like that here. As you can see, there is no Google tracking on this website either. No cookies are set either. eLabFTW is all about taking the control back of your data.
