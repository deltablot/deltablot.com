## What you get with PRO Support

* Email support: if you have any issue you can be sure it will be addressed quickly.
* Priority on feature requests: eLabFTW is used by a huge amount of labs, and they all want more from the software. Unfortunately, all the features cannot be implemented in a timely manner. With PRO Support you get in front of the line and the features you request will be treated in priority.
* Training sessions: you can request training sessions for users so they can harness the full potential of the app and learn tips and tricks.
* Open source funding: as you can imagine, when you distribute something for free, it's hard to earn money from it. By buying PRO Support you ensure the continued development of eLabFTW but also other software bricks as part of the money is redistributed to other developers.
* Helping the planet: part of the funds also go to plant trees and carbon offset, because oxygen is important! ;)

## What you get with PRO Hosting

### PRO Support

Everything described above is included.

### Peace of mind

Don't worry about software updates, vulnerabilities, backups and all the problems that might come with the self hosted option. Let us deal with that and focus on your research.

### Security

The server hosting your data will host only your data. It is a CentOS Entreprise Linux server that has been very carefully configured to offer the most secure environment for your data.

Things that are configured include:

* A very strict SSH configuration
* Monitoring of changes and suspect actions
* Auditing of changes and actions
* Logging of activity
* Tuned kernel settings
* and more...

### Data integrity

The MySQL database is configured in High Availability mode with two nodes, with automatic healing and failover. If the primary node is no longer operational, the secondary node will take over. Your data is redundant and its integrity is therefore guaranteed.

### Data confidentiality

Your data is yours and yours only. There is no "sharing with third-party for marketing purposes" or other nasty things like that here. As you can see, there is no Google tracking on this website. No cookies are set either. eLabFTW is all about taking the control back of your data.
